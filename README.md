# Week-4-Game
Homework for Week 4


This homework was certainly challenging.

I declared several arrays to store all of the data for several characters in an array. I deviated slightly from the game requirements and instead added in a "rock-paper-scissors" element, alongside a mana bar for Special Abilities, however, I am pressed for time on finishing that. This whole project has taken me in excess of like 15 hours.

How to play: Click on a character to select your player, then click on an enemy to select them as your opponent. Each opponent has separate abilities (extra, but not yet completed), and has 3 abilities: attacking, dodging, and their unique special ability. These are controlled through buttons.

You must defeat all 3 enemies to win. Good luck!
